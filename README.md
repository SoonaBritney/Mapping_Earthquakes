# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and which shows all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and the data on a third map.

# Technology
(1) Mapbox Mapping JavaScript library
(2) Leaflet Mapping JavaScript library
(3) JSON data
(4) HTML, Style.css

# Approach
Your approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. You'll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data. Now that you have an overview of the project plan, let's set up a Mapbox account and get the API token you'll need to create geographical maps.

# JSon Data
(1) Tectonic plate data - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json
(2) Earthquake data - https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson


# Tasks
#### Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data (Streets View)

#### Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data (Satellite View)

#### Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map (Dark Map View)

# Conclusion
We can visualize the JSON data on the map by utilizing the Mapbox Mapping JavaScript libruary and Leaflet Mapping JavaScript libruary.
